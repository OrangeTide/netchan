# build-diagrams.sh -- render diagram and plot sources to SVG.
#
# Usage: build-diagrams.sh [-k] [-o OUT.svg] SOURCE...
#
#   -k         keep going when a renderer is missing (warn, skip that file)
#   -o OUT     output path; only valid with a single SOURCE
#   SOURCE...  one or more diagram sources, dispatched by extension
#
# By default the SVG is written next to its source, which is what makes the
# rest of the pipeline work without configuration: build-site.sh copies
# non-Markdown companion files into the output, so `![](graph.svg)` resolves
# in the editor, on the GitHub blob page, and in the built site.
#
#   .dot .gv       graphviz     apt install graphviz
#   .msc           mscgen       apt install mscgen
#   .plt .gnuplot  gnuplot      apt install gnuplot
#   .pic           pikchr, or groff -p as a fallback (groff is near-universal)
#   .d2            d2           single Go binary, no runtime      (unverified)
#   .mmd .mermaid  mmdc         npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli (unverified)
#
# "unverified" means the dispatch was written from the tool's documentation but
# never executed, because neither tool was installable on the machine where
# this was built. graphviz, gnuplot, mscgen, and pikchr are exercised. If a d2
# or mermaid figure misbehaves, suspect the invocation here first.
#
# A missing renderer is an error, not a warning: a silently absent figure looks
# like a working page until someone reads it. Use -k when a contributor should
# be able to build the prose without installing every tool, but never in CI.
#
# Graphviz layout engine: the default is `dot`. Override per file with a magic
# first line, which keeps the choice with the diagram instead of in the build:
#
#   // pages-site: engine=neato
